# **Optician-Math**

### **Overview**

A script that can used by opticians, optician apprentices, and optical techs.
functions indlude:
* Transposing a spectacle lens Rx back and forth from positive to negative cylinder forms.
* Finding power on an oblique axis and determining any induced prism.
* Lens vertex calculations.
* Pantoscopic and retroscopic tilt calculations.
* Resultant power from changes in positive and negative face-form.
* Minimum blank sizing for single vision lenses.
* Base curve calculations using the nominal lens formula and vogel's rule.

### **Technology used**
* Python

### **What I learned**
* project planning before coding, and breaking down problem into managable tasks
* creating and managing a github respository
* commits, and pulls, and pushes using git
* Information collection from documentation, stack overflow, google, etc.
* input validation and value error exception statements
* conditionals, functions, and loops
* import of libraries, specific implentation was for trig functions
* I/O behaviors
